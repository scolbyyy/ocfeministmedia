	<h2>Developer's Notes</h2>

	<article>
		<h3>Hosting</h3>
		<p>This site is hosted on Infinity Free.</p>
		<h3>Domain</h3>
		<p>The domain name was acquired via Freenom. It must be renewed May 2025 for the site to continue existing at this location.</p>
		<h3>SSL</h3>
		<p>The SSL certificate was acquired (for free) through Let's Encrypt and will need to be renewed around 2024. If your device is giving you a connection not secure message try typing https://ocfeministmedia.ml into the address bar.</p>
		<h3>For future students</h3>
		<p>If you're interested in continuing/growing the website on this server/domain (ocfeministmedia.ml), I gave Professor Blaylock the CPanel log-in etc. Message me if you have questions: scolby@oberlin.edu You may find it simpler to copy paste my code into your own server - see "open source" section.</p>
		<h3>For archivists</h3>
		<p>If you are interested in this site for archive purposes, github pages is its most stable location. The site will live at: https://scolbyyy.github.io/ocfeministmedia/index.html in perpetuity. Better to save that address than this one just in case some component needs upkeep here and no one is maintaining it.</p>
		<h3>Open source</h3>
		<p>All my HTML and CSS can be found at: https://scolbyyy.github.io/ocfeministmedia/index.html Remix it all you'd like.</p>
