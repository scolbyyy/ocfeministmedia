		<h3>The Story of <i>Coming Out</i></h3>

		<p>Through many feminist movements there has been a need for grassroots movements in order to allow these ideals to exist and flourish in society. To stand against the current political opinions requires rebelling up against the current establishment and the power they have. <i>Coming Out</i> was an Oberlin paper with the purpose of giving a voice to women on campus, as they were primarily kept silent under publications such as <i>The Oberlin Review</i>. Originally, <i>Coming Out</i> began as <i>What the Review Wouldn’t Print</i>, a publication dedicated to showcasing the stories of women that weren’t represented in <i>The Oberlin Review</i>. On the front page of <i>What the Review Wouldn’t Print</i> lay “No More Diplomacy,” an article discussing the main reasoning behind the new publication. The article cited the lack of coverage by <i>The Oberlin Review</i> of the Women's Conference, which had over 300 people registered for it, as a central part of its critique of <i>The Review</i>. Meanwhile, Al Liberalstein, who had come to Oberlin monthly to talk to an “embarrassingly small audience” (<i>What the Review Wouldn’t Print</i>, pg. 1), had an entire half-page article dedicated to him. After this print, <i>What the Review Wouldn’t Print</i> was rebranded to <i>Coming Out</i>, allowing the paper to have its own identity. <i>Coming Out</i>’s origins came from a need for the coverage of women and their movements. The Oberlin students who founded <i>Coming Out</i> demanded change.</p>

		<p>Throughout the course of <i>Coming Out</i>’s lifespan, all of the work to publish and distribute the paper was entirely done by volunteers. Many of the staff were either students or townspeople from Oberlin willing to dedicate themselves to the publication and feminist issues. In addition, though certain articles were written by men (namely Volume 1, Number 4’s article titled “A Male Guide to Women’s Liberation”), the staff was entirely women. This allowed them to “focus on the difficulties of woman to woman discussion” (Coming Out, Volume 1, Number 3). <i>Coming Out</i> sought to mediate women-to-women conversation and activism.</p>

		<p>In January of 1974, an article in <i>The Oberlin Review</i> titled "<i>Coming Out</i>: A Premature Death?"  discussed a meeting of roughly fifteen attendants about the future of <i>Coming Out</i>. This meeting marked the end of Coming Out as a publication. Many of these papers still reside in the Oberlin Archive. What started as <i>What the Review Wouldn't Print</i> became a vibrant alternative paper that pushed against the established news outlets on campus to provide a place where women could write about their personal experiences, global issues such as the war in Vietnam, and the battles for Women's rights. <i>Coming Out</i> was the footing for many young feminists at Oberlin, standing against their own school and student body for what was right. Coming Out represents what it means to be a feminist, to fight and struggle for equality, even when the entire world around you forces you down.</p>

		<h3>Transcription</h3>
		<p><span class="chonk">Liz:</span> Liz: You asked me before about the name, <i>Coming Out</i>, and I think “coming out” has a different connotation today than it did then. And it was just beginning to be identified with LGBTQ and, so we talked about that, was that actually going to label us [Coming Out] as an LGBTQ organiziation? When most feminists were labeled as lesbians and man haters anyway. That’s actually how we were seen regardless of our sexuality. So there was a little danger in taking that name, but we decided that “coming out” had a broader meaning for us, it was coming out of our homes, coming out of our classrooms, coming out of our dormrooms, and coming together and having a voice and speaking out, and that included minorities, it included different sexual orintations. It was actually a fairly intersectional group and an intersectional voice, but as intersection women.</p>
		<p class="purple"><span class="chonk">Seamus:</span> So for my first question here, what did it mean to be a feminist at Oberlin?</p>
		<p><span class="chonk">Liz:</span> Oh, so you have to give some context for the time, it was a very tumultuous time where the Vietnam war was underway, the black power movement, Cesar Chavez and the workers movement. Women had been involved in all of those, but mainly in a supporting role in a lot of them rather than a leadership role. At Oberlin, there was a kind of schizophrenia at the same time that the first coed dorm, called the experimental dorm, was underway. The freshmen, I came as freshman and I was in an all freshman women’s dorm, and we had 2 dorm mothers, both called Mrs. Smith, and curfews and no men were allowed in our dorm rooms; except on weekends and there had to be a wastebasket in the door to keep it open. So, there was this weird, juxtaposition of things happening in the world, as well as at Oberlin.</p>
		<p class = "purple"><span class="chonk">Seamus:</span> So, how do you think (...) media as a whole helped feminist movements?</p>
		<p><span class = "chonk">Liz:</span> They helped or hurt?</p>
		<p class = "purple"><span class="chonk">Seamus:</span> Helped, helped.</p>
		<p><span class="chonk">Liz:</span> Haha, well the media that helped were a separate media, like Ms. Magazine and other feminist publications. The media as a whole, you tended to either portray the feminist movement as a joke, you know, even making things up; like bra burning which never happened, and even twisting things. We had a conference on sexual abuse, and during the conference one sentance was about the fact that there was a possibility that there could be false accusations and that became the headline in the local headline, it was “False Accusations”. After a whole weekend of conference, that one line made the headline. So the media was not very responsive and supportive of the women’s movement.</p>
		<p class = "purple"><span class="chonk">Seamus:</span> How did you decide to get involved with <i>Coming Out?</i></p>
		<p><span class="chonk">Liz:</span> Um, well, the initial movement had many different aspects to it, for example there was the Open Women’s Service Center which formed and started of townspeople and women and started the first domestic violence shelter as well as the first rape crisis hotline in the county. But there was also this overlapping group of people, and we all overlapped with each other, it was the same group of women in town and college and two of them worked at a local print shop and were also friends of mine and we decided to write our own publication. I think, Seamus as you discovered, there was not only a lack of coverage, the lack of coverage of women's events on campus was stark and notable. They would cover all sorts of things on campus, but not the women's movement including a women's conference that went on. So the alternative was to start our own publication in our own newspaper.</p>
		<p class = "purple"><span class="chonk">Seamus:</span> How would you say <i>Coming Out</i> differed from <i>The Oberlin Review?</i> I mean there is the fact that <i>Coming Out</i> primarily covered women's issues but would you say that there were any other major differences?</p>
		<p><span class="chonk">Liz:</span> The major difference I felt as the time was that the Review covered campus issues it tended to avoid issues, controversial issues such as the Vietnam war or the women's movement or the black power movement. So it was a much more centrist organization than a lot of other activities on campus and then <i>Coming Out</i> not only covered campus and town issues but also tried to cover global issues as well, which was a pretty adventurous task for the small group of volunteers. We actually had a foreign correspondent as an alum, a graduate who ended up in southeast asia and wrote back to us so that we could publish her reports!</p>
		<p class = "purple"><span class="chonk">Seamus:</span> … A man named Jon Adler suggested printing a paper that was similar to <i>Coming Out</i> but instead got voices from multiple different minority groups and <i>Coming Out</i>, I believe, refused this offer to keep its own identity, to focus on itself, even though there was dying out support. Do you still think that you still would have … refused that offer today?</p>
		<p><span class="chonk">Liz:</span> I think at that point in time it was very important for women's voices to be heard and for it to be purely women's voices because their voices had been so diluted in all the other movements during that period. During the Vietnam movement, women were behind the scenes constantly working, but their voice was not out front and the same thing with the black power movement when black women's voices were not out front and the workers rights. I mean it's and so in some way I think it was important for that moment in time for women's voices to be solo. So it was heard, undiluted. I think it was also important for women to know at that point in time that they could have their voice heard; that they could publish, make an instrument that got their voice out there now and I think feminism and women's voices are being heard more and more; at least in this country and some European countries that in many countries women's voices are out there. And so I think it's more important to bring together a more intersectional voice [today] and to support each other, so I think that would be possible now but I think back then it was important to keep this voice, a woman's voice.</p>
		<p class = "purple"><span class="chonk">Seamus:</span> Why did <i>Coming Out</i> end, in your opinion?</p>
		<p><span class="chonk">Liz:</span> I think it ended as all volunteer organizations do, there were not enough people and not enough financial support to keep it going. It was a major endeavor, it was, you know, for some of us a half time job, and as well as other things we were doing within the women's movement. It was a lot of work by a lot of really dedicated people and I don't think that can go on forever. I also think that at some point the college started to pay attention. Now I'm not sure that there is a correlation, but following that, there was - in later years - there was the committee on the status of women and women's issues began to be more seriously considered at the college; especially with a change of leadership, president Fuller (Fuller had become president of Oberlin in 1970) was very committed to the women's movement.</p>
		<p class = "purple"><span class="chonk">Seamus:</span> If someone were to start a similar publication today, would you have any, I suppose advice for them?</p>
		<p><span class="chonk">Liz:</span> I think my advice to somebody starting something like that is, work out a plan for sustainability. Either make sure that there's a way to replace yourself as the energy or find a way to institutionalize it by making it a real organization and find some money to keep it going. Because we were pulling out of our own pockets just to keep the paper and the printing company, which was owned by two folks in town Mike Sabers and Ruth Sabers, really subsidized the printing process a lot for us. So you just can't, in a lot of ways, you can't depend on that indefinitely, that volunteer and donated labor forever. So my advice would be to find a way to make it more sustainable, but still keep your voice heard and you keep your voice pure. You know if you can't be heard someplace in the traditional media you need to find a way to have your voice be heard so go for it.</p>
