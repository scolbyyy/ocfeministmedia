		<p>Our goal with this project is to share how a diverse set of positions and political actions on issues pertinent to marginalized communities at Oberlin College were articulated by media organizations on campus during the 1970s and 80s. We looked for stories of feminist activism at Oberlin College and asked how that activism was mediated by campus newspapers, flyers, and radio programs. Our position is one of curiosity and general dedication to documenting the activity of women’s groups and intersectional women-related activities that were present on campus during this moment. Our commitment to documenting this moment comes from our belief in the significance and power of archival research. Here we are activist observers who document the process of change.</p>
		<p>As Oberlin students in 2022, we have spent our adolescence and transition into young adulthood in a political moment defined by its turbulence and uncertainty. We have come of age alongside massive cultural upheavals regarding oppressive regimes of gender, race, sexuality, class, and all those predicated on the subjugation of marginalized identities, as well as with the tremendous pushback which such movements have incurred.</p>
		<p>Most of the materials that we looked through came in the years following the legalization of abortion, and along with it a federal affirmation of women’s rights in the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade (1973). Not only did this case galvanize a generation of young feminists, it also set the precedent upon which numerous vital civil rights judicial victories have been won in the decades since. The history of women’s rights in the United States, as taught in many of our pre-college educations, paints a picture of a slow, yet definitive march towards gender equality, with Roe as a prime example of such movement. This narrative has been increasingly proved false over the brief span of our lifetimes. The more familiar we became with this history the clearer it became that history repeats itself. Over the course of this project in 2022, we have experienced the impending undoing of Roe, and along with it the radical and dehumanizing declaration that marginalized people do not deserve control over their own bodies.</p>
		<p>Looking back at Oberlin College in the 1970s and 80s allowed us to ground our personal contemporary experiences in relation to the feminist futures of Oberlin’s past. We developed emotional connections to our work. For some of us this history was felt through the movement of our bodies in protest. Walking to and from a reproductive justice protest in Tappan Square to the Oberlin College Archives at MUDD or the WOBC historical materials at Wilder where we marinated in the archival details to see the ways that the women of Oberlin from decades ago made space for these very issues, and themselves altogether, illuminated the possibility of seeing the study of history as coalition building with the past. In our research we saw the messes, successes, blood, sweat, tears, and joy of women involved in this movement. The documents within these archives show critical connections and contradictions between the experiences and initiatives of women on Oberlin’s campus of the 1970s and 80s with those of our own. They push and ask for recognition of the hard work and reproductive labor of women on Oberlin campus during this period. What is revealed by looking at them is both essential for making sense of our current cultural and political national moment, as well as that of the nuanced gendered past of our own specific institution. Through this project we continually seek the diverging roots of a multitude of contemporary feminisms.</p>

		<h3>Feminism as a Force</h3>
		<p>Feminism can be seen as a monolithic force, one polar extreme in a “culture war.” In reality, feminism is a collection of fierce internal arguments. The study of 1970s and 80s feminisms at Oberlin College challenges the idea that our current activist landscape is uniquely vitriolic or disjointed. This can be very comforting because although the feminisms of the 70s and 80s had flaws—as ours do now, since there is no such thing as a perfect, one-size-fits-all response to constructs as fluid and complex as gender, race, class, etc.— those feminists from generations before us accomplished vital work that is still deeply relevant in people’s lives today. Within activist movements, individuals have their own ideas and opinions that may differ and be in conflict, but we see these contradictions as a creative well of activist approaches for future generations. This can give us hope that our own work does not need to be flawless to be useful. It also reminds us that we do not need to fear conflict among ourselves. Some conflicts are generative.</p>
		<p>History, and time itself, can’t be adequately summarized through a purely linear model. We thus also sought to apply feminist methodologies to our historical inquiries. Affirming that feminism is mediated through the uncovering of ways of thinking and being that deviate from those demanded by the dominant white patriarchal capitalist paradigm in which we live, we contend that a feminist media history can only come from a careful examination of the past, with a deliberate emphasis on what appears to be missing from the broader accepted narrative. Feminist historiography requires us to look for the gaps in the narrative, and question why it is that those gaps exist at all, what is purposefully omitted in their creation, and who benefits from such historical erasure. In this way, feminism is mediated through the retraining of our own eyes and ears to read between the lines and hear what is unspoken. It is necessarily an ongoing, everyday process that requires our constant attention.</p>
		<p>As Oberlin students, we are in a position of extreme privilege relative to those without access to higher education, which is something that cannot be separated from the research that we conduct. We must also acknowledge the spaces we ourselves, as Oberlin students, have occupied as we conducted our research. The colonized land upon which Oberlin was founded was once inhabited by the Mound Builders, the Wyandot, Seneca-Cayuga, and the Erie peoples. Their history has also been historically silenced.</p>
		<p>Some of us are pessimistic. No matter how much we care or try, these feminist media histories can only have so much influence on the world. As a small group of students researching and discussing feminist media history in a liberal arts college, we don’t assume that through our work we can shake the world’s view on feminism. There may be no impact. It could be that nothing will be changed. Feminism takes constant effort and a lot, a lot, a lot of time. What we hope is that in the process of improving ourselves and our own understanding of Obie history, we might possibly positively influence those beyond ourselves. Sometimes we have to take some baby steps in order to create movement.</p>
		<p>The time we have spent researching has advanced our understanding of media at Oberlin. For those of us who are participants in media organizations on campus, this research helps us understand our role in social change as media practitioners and can help future Oberlin students imagine where to take these media organizations in the future. However, this work is not only relevant to Oberlin College students, staff, faculty, and alumni. It can also speak to potential shared experiences across other small liberal arts colleges during the same era. Additionally, Oberlin attracts people from many different places and contexts, thus feminisms at Oberlin have reflected both wider national and international perspectives. However, histories of Oberlin feminisms do not reflect all feminism.</p>
		<p>We tried to always approach the archive by critically asking questions about the past. While many of the documents that we read do primarily focus on white cis women, we sought to move beyond this narrow focus. We might never find what we were looking for or come close to the truth, but the process of digging for the answers we affirm has been a valuable experience because we have learned and improved. What has been of lasting importance for us is to take the opportunity to sit down, research, discuss and reflect on what we have found and learned and properly document it so that it may be of help to those who come after us. We chose to not only share our research and plainly state what we have seen in the archive, but we also often opted to include key documents from our research on our website so that readers may engage with the archival evidence that was compelling to us. Our goal is for our work to contribute to the searching and learning journey of others.</p>
