		<p id = "quote"> “WOBC is a student-run freeform community radio station broadcasting 24 hours a day at 91.5-FM in Lorain County, Ohio, and on the web at wobc.org. A non-commercial station located at Oberlin College, WOBC broadcasts more than 150 programs weekly–talk shows, news reports, music shows spanning all genres, and live performances–each conceived and produced by volunteer DJs. Daily operations are handled by a five-member administrative board and a volunteer staff of over 30.” (From the WOBC website wobc.org)</p>
		
		<p>The on-campus radio station at Oberlin College, WOBC has a long-standing history as a student-run media organization. Starting in 1949 originally as KOCN according to an Oral history report from WOBC done in 1989 it is Oberlin’s “largest ongoing extracurricular activity”. To be able to critically look at WOBC from a feminist lens we first must understand it as a media organization and its history up to and through the 70s and 80s. A WOBC annual report from 1960-1961 stated “The operation of WOBC is no one-man job…90 persons on the station Staff.” When viewing these archival documents we as a class question the role women had in the creation of said documents. Already in the rhetoric referring to a “one-man job” erases the existence of women in the WOBC workforce. In the same annual report, a list of all staff and their positions showed a low percentage of women holding WOBC jobs. For example, making up 33% of the Popular Music Disc Jockeys or 24% of the Newscasters. The top student job of the station is that of the Program Director. In a set of applications for the position with upwards of 10 male applicants, we found only two female applicants, Janice Derr and Susan Fitzwater, who applied together to be co-directors. Women are often in a position where to be able to compete with a man they must have double the amount of women. With the history of male program directors, it may have seemed as if women can’t move up in WOBC and saw their only chance as to have to work together.</p>

		<p>The archives show us everyday misogynistic rhetoric in WOBC. We see how erasing women and putting them on the back burner was a pattern of underlying institutionalized sexism. For example,  In a letter found in the archives from the Oberlin College Student Network talking to the board, they write “The secretary shall serve at the pleasure of the board of trustees.” And even more aggressive in a Correspondence about incoming staff trainees to the station we see: “they’re a good looking bunch (especially the girls).” Before the women even step into the station they are put into a docile sexually objectified role. This correspondence was for those training the incomers and start of their relationship to the new people for their own sexual viewing. That it’s important what the trainees look like and to expect to be pleased by the women's beauty. It drastically changes the “girls” further into an objectified role.</p>

		<p>We find it important in our media history to markdown women's involvement. Seeing ourselves in the archives and our research on how quickly women can be erased we want to shine a light on female-led media existence at WOBC. One of the radio shows we found in the archives from an alumni magazine from 1974 refers to the show: “HERSTORY” describing it as “A women’s show that deals exclusively with the music and achievements of women as well as women’s news and any information pertinent to women.” Unfortunately, we tried for the semester to find more information on the show but were unsuccessful. Basil Musgrove’s section looks more into specific radio shows by annotating a history of WOBC program guides.</p>

		<p>The WOBC Oral History is a key way to seeing how women were treated throughout the decades of the organization. Following decade by decade, the accounts are mostly from men to men in conversation about what their time was like. Below I’ve provided examples of how women were seen, discussed, and referenced throughout the guide.</p>

		<p>At the end of the discussion of the 60s on page 45 Randy Bongarten offhandedly mentions women for the first time stating:<p>
	</article>

	<div class = "image">
		<img src = "images/oralhist1.jpg" alt = "BONGARTEN: Many women participated at WOBC, although most of them not in high positions. In the early 1970s there was one female music director and news director.">
	</div>

	<article>
		<p> There's no explanation of how many women participated or how they did. It seems to imply only two positions of power held by women at some point in the 70s, showing a huge gap for a seemingly entire decade.</p>
		<p>On page 57 one of only 14 women included in the index (in comparison to the 151 men cited) Barbra Ward Grubb speaking about 70s WOBC is quoted saying:</p>
	</article>

	<div class = "image">
		<img src = "images/oralhist2.png" alt = "GRUBB: Women always were in the minority at WOBC, but it never struck me as a problem. It was more a question of whether you could do what you set out to do. I'm sure there are market studies saying that male voices are more interesting to listen to than female voices. But I was really grateful that in that heyday of struggling for a woman's identity, it was not the case at WOBC. It was wonderful. You're really there, either you could cut it or you couldn't and you could act or you couldn't and you had your third-class license or you didn't.">
	</div>

	<article>
		<p>It’s interesting to hear from a women referring to this not as a problem. It adds a question to how possibly women had to accept the surroundings to be able to have any voice in the male dominated environment. Or perhaps it shows a complexic dynamics to the environment with some women having had a positive experience and we wonder what contributes to those circumstances.</p>
		<p>Kristen Webb, another of the 14 women on page 58 speaks showing that female representation has been an issue discussed since the 70s:</p>
	</article>

	<div class = "image">
		<img src = "images/oralhist3.jpg" alt = "WEBB: I remember some very acrimonious Executive Board meetings and discussions about who was going to get to be on staff for Winter Term and some people saying that we needed more women. Actually, we needed people who whatever their race, creed, color, or sex would keep us on the air. That kind of professionalism is something that has always stuck with me. No matter what, you don't go off the air--you keep going and never apologize for your mistakes.">
	</div>

	<article>
		<p>On page 70 Josh Rubin who is now speaking on the 80s states:</p>
	</article>

	<div class = "image">
		<img src = "images/oralhist4.jpg" alt = "RUBIN: We established a very flexible structure. When I was program director in charge of music, I hired the conventional four areas: pop, jazz, contemporary, and classical. And I announced that I would take all the catch-all stuff. There used to be a Sunday afternoon ghetto for all the weird stuff that didn't fit the four categories. We would run around--Oh, is Judy Friedman going to do her women's show again?">
	</div>

	<article>
		<p>Once again interesting how “women” is its own topic. Women are an outsider, they are an other. They do not “fit in the four catagories.” instead of questioning why women did not fit into the generic categories.</p>
		<p>It wasn’t until the 90s that the station began to look at its institutional forms of hiring. In a WOBC State of the Station Report from March 1991, it is stated “The station is opened up to a border part of the student body on campus and for the most part WOBC is no longer the “only fraternity/sorority on campus.” Its disalarmning to hear that WOBC would have been referred to fraternities and sororities. Institutions often considered to be one of the most exclusive, hetronoarmatvie, white dominated, clichy, and specifically restrictive. Greek life is famous for choosing specific people that fit the image which often refers to conveniently attractive, straight, whiteness. Although this is not the time period we are focusing on for our research it gives an important perspective on how the station was perceived until that point: exclusive, restrictive, or Clichy. They began to put promotional flyers around campus to advertise new jobs, which is still practiced now. In the same station report they refer to the first big  push to start advertising new positions to the greater campus and not those within the community already. From context it seems as if this is celebrated as a first for WOBC making it seem as if they were not advertising before. Which creates an institutional exclusivity based on those who are already in coherance with those in power at WOBC, which feeds quickly into bias hiring.</p>
