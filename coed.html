		<p>During my research on 1970s and ‘80s feminism at Oberlin, I began by focusing on student organizations. These organizations, events, and activities may be indicative of broader attitudes of the student body at the time, and how these students both conceptualized and participated in feminist movements. Through the Guide to Women’s History Sources in the Oberlin College Archives, I was able to gain insight into the assortment of organizations, how these groups evolved over time, and how they might reflect the ways in which the “second-wave” feminist movement manifested at the College.</p>
		<p>My main finding, however, came from a Life magazine article about Oberlin College written in November of 1970, entitled “An Intimate Revolution: Co-ed Dorms Put Boys and Girls Together.” Starting around the 1960’s, American higher education institutions began integrating women (specifically, white women) into the “general” population (i.e. male students). Prior to this, although some institutions may have been co-ed, there were still strict rules with respect to interactions between men and women. It was common for women students to have a curfew, housemothers to oversee the dorms, and limited (if any) visiting hours when students of one gender were permitted to enter the dorms of the other. The experience of college for men and women, respectively, shared little similarity other than location – nor were they meant to. But, with the ‘70s came second wave feminism and the sexual revolution, and, particularly at a place like Oberlin, where students are given a large amount of autonomy, this was embraced by a large population of students.</p>

		<p>Parents, on the other hand, had concerns about this new cohabitation of the genders. It is difficult to know what percentage of parents accepted the change in housing options, but I would imagine that this scandalous announcement would elicit a significant amount of pearl-clutching from those of an older generation. Some of these parents were unambiguously concerned about an increased potential for sexual interacts between male and female students, and that “the good clean fun of the good old days – dating for proms, football games, fraternity beer parties – will be replaced by measures more ominously orgiastic.” (pp. 32)  However, the author seems to be in favor of this progressive new policy, remarking that “To a surprising extent, these worries are not supported by the facts of coeducational living at Oberlin, or at the many other colleges and universities around the US where it is practiced in various forms.” (pp.32)</p>

		<p>This newfound practice of cohabitation proved to be an opportunity for maturation for some men, who discovered for the first time that it is possible for them to have platonic relationships with women. One freshman, David Jensen, summarizes this sentiment well by stating that “suddenly I found myself taking [women] more for granted as people, something I’d never done before.” (pp. 36)  At least according to this article, this controversial opportunity benefitted men and women alike by providing students with an opportunity to strengthen their platonic connections with other genders.</p>
		<p>Through this article we are able to see how not only can media be used for the advancement of political movements, but also how media, like all art, is a reflection of life at the time of publishing. Furthermore, my research on this topic has emphasized to me Oberlin’s enduring legacy of “letting the students make their own rules has had a further unpredictable effect,” sometimes to the point where “the political radicalization that has explosively divided many campuses has scarcely been felt at Oberlin.” (pp 3.9)</p>
